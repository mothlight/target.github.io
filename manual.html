<h4>MET forcing data</h4>
<p>TARGET requires reference meteorological data to drive the model and calculate microscale urban air temperature. The following meteorological variables are required: incoming shortwave (solar) radiation, incoming longwave (terrestrial), relative humidity, reference wind speed (typically at 10 m), and air temperature. The user must define the height above ground of reference wind speed and air temperature measurements. Ideally, meteorological data should be representative of a nearby urban site. However, the nearest airport weather station will suffice. Ideally, the ground surface characteristics (i.e. % of plan area of model land cover types) below the reference weather (i.e within 125 m radius of station) station should also be defined. If this is unknown assume reference station land cover is 100% dry grass. 
<p>Meteorological data should be stored in csv format with the following column headers:
<p>datetime – date and time, e.g. 1/1/2011 12:00
<br>Ta – air temperature in degrees Celsius
<br>RH – relative humidity in percentage
<br>WS – wind speed in meters per second
<br>P – atmospheric pressure in mb/hPa
<br>Kd – incoming shortwave radiation in Wm-2
<br>Ld – incoming longwave radiation in Wm-2

<h4>Land cover data</h4>

<p>Land cover data should be provided for the entire domain. The planar fraction of land cover types and building heights and widths for each grid cell are defined in a csv file will the following format:
<p>FID – cell identifier, unique numerical number for each grid point.
<br>roof – fractional roof planar area
<br>road – fractional road planar area
<br>watr – factional water planar area
<br>conc – fractional concrete planar area
<br>Veg – fractional tree planar area
<br>dry – fractional dry grass area 
<br>irr – fractional irrigated grass/low vegetation area
<br>H – average building height (m)
<br>W – average street width, distance between buildings (m)

<p>These data can be derived at resolution of the user choice. A resolution of 30 – 50m is recommended to captures microscale effects. If the user has exiting raster land cover datasets, an easy way to tabulate these data is (1) define a fishnet with resolution 30 m and (2) use ArcGIS function “tabulate area”.

<h4>Model output</h4>

<p>The model output is netCDF format. By default, all variables are written to the output. To suppress some variables, they can be added to the control file, as below
<p>disableOutput=Utb,Fid,modUTaRef,TbRur,HttcCan,HttcUrbNew,TsurfWall,TsurfCan,TsurfHorz,Ucan
<p>The variables Tac, Tmrt, and UTCI will always be outputted.
<p>The domain dimensions are set in the control file, for example, as below giving the top left x,y coordinate, the resolution of each grid square, and the x,y dimensions of the domain.
<p>DomainDim=344,235
